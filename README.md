# circle-fit

A JavaScript library for fast circle fitting of a set of 2D points.

The implementation is based on a Least-Squares method to find the 3 unknowns : x and y coordinates and the radius.

# Speed and stability

The algorithm do not contain any iterative solvers and will find a solution in linear time, meaning that you will have the result instantly.  
This library handles degenerate cases when you do not have enough non-colinear points to determine a correct circle by returning an error flag.

# Getting started

The library is simple to use. Include `circlefit.js`, the global object `CIRCLEFIT` is automatically created.
This object have 3 methods :

- `addPoint(x, y)` : add a point to the set
- `clearPoints()` : remove all points
- `compute()` : execute the solver and return an object containing the result.

# Result object

The result object contains more than the circle informations, here are all the parameters :

- `success (Boolean)` : status of the computation
- `points (Array)` : all points given by the user
- `projections (Array)` : projections of each points onto the circle
- `distances (Array)` : distance of each points to the circle
- `center (Object)` : center of the circle
- `radius (Number)` : radius of the circle
- `residue (Number)` : residue of the least squares method, can be use to define the quality of the circle

# Example

```javascript
  var myPoints = [ ... ];
  myPoints.forEach(function(point) {
    CIRCLEFIT.addPoint(point.x, point.y);
  });
  var result = CIRCLEFIT.compute();
  if (result.success) {
    console.log("Center = {" + result.center.x + "," + result.center.y + "}, Radius = " + result.radius);
  }
```
